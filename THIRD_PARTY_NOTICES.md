and LED mapping follow Chessnut's published API and were cross-checked against
the GPL-3.0 chessnutair reference implementation. The buzzer command encoding
follows Chessnut's MIT-licensed EasyLinkSDK. The Android/Kotlin transport and
Dart game integration are new adaptations for Mobile Maia and are

Mobile Maia's Game Review move-classification and sacrifice-detection
heuristics are adapted and translated to Dart from the linked En Croissant
source. Mobile Maia modifies the upstream implementation with
background-isolate execution, conservative annotation evidence checks in all analysis modes and
app-specific review integration. The independent test reference under
`tool/hardening/classification/reference` also includes the upstream scoring,
annotation and material-search functions. The
adapted code remains subject to GPL-3.0; Mobile Maia as a combined application
is distributed under AGPL-3.0-only as permitted by section 13 of AGPL-3.0.
