# Mobile Maia Preview

> **Prerelease channel:** This repository contains experimental Mobile Maia
> builds. The Android package ID is separate from the stable app, so **Mobile
> Maia Preview** can be installed beside **Mobile Maia** without replacing it.

An offline-first Android chess app for playing against Maia-3, reviewing games
with Maia and Stockfish, and exporting PGN.

Built around [Maia-3](https://github.com/CSSLab/maia3), the human-like chess
engine developed by the University of Toronto Computational Social Science Lab.

## User guide

### Analysis Board

Select **Analysis Board** from the home screen to explore a position without
starting a game. Stockfish continuously supplies the evaluation and blue
best-move arrow, while Maia supplies its orange human-move recommendation at
the configured analysis rating.

The actions menu can load FEN or PGN text, copy the current FEN or complete PGN,
open the graphical board editor, or start a Maia game from the current position
as White, Black, or a random side. The board editor follows Lichess's toggle
interaction: select a piece and tap an empty square to add it, or tap the same
piece already on the board to remove it. It also controls side to move and
castling rights. The complete Lichess CC0 opening-name dataset is bundled for
offline ECO codes, detailed variation names, and transposition-aware matching.

Select any earlier move and play a different continuation to create an inline,
clickable PGN variation without deleting the existing line. Active games,
reviews, complete analysis trees, the selected position, board orientation,
and clock state are checkpointed locally and restored after Android process
death, device restart, or an app update.

### Start a game

Choose White, Black, or a random side, set Maia's rating, and select a clock.
Mobile Maia works entirely offline: the Maia-3 model and Stockfish are bundled
with the app, and no account is required.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/setup.jpg" width="38%" alt="Choose a side, Maia rating, and time control">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/advanced.jpg" width="38%" alt="Advanced Maia timing and sampling controls">
</p>

Advanced settings control human-like move timing, Temperature, Top-P, and the
rating used for Maia's human-move suggestion during review. The default review
rating is 1600. **Copy diagnostics** is also available here if a reproducible
screen error needs investigation.

#### Temperature and Top-P

Maia-3 predicts a probability distribution over the legal moves in each
position. **Temperature** and **Top-P** control how Mobile Maia selects a move
from that distribution; they do not change the model's weights or make Maia
search like Stockfish.

- **Temperature 0** is deterministic: Maia always chooses its
  highest-probability move. Raising Temperature allows progressively more
  variety and gives lower-probability moves a greater chance of being played.
- **Top-P 1.0** keeps the complete legal-move distribution. Lower values keep
  only the most probable moves up to the selected cumulative-probability
  threshold before Maia samples one of them.
- **Mobile Maia's defaults—Temperature 0.5 and Top-P 0.9—**provide human-like
  variety while reducing low-probability outliers. For the most reproducible
  top-choice policy, use Temperature 0 and Top-P 1.0.

These settings are not extra Elo controls. They can change the character and
consistency of play at a given rating, but there is no reliable conversion such
as “lowering Temperature adds 200 Elo.” Keep them fixed while judging which
Maia rating gives you the training experience you want.

For a deeper explanation, see the
[Maia3 local-stack sampling guide](https://github.com/Dash1971/maia3-local-stack#temperature-and-topp).

### Play and take back

Tap or drag pieces to play. The status card shows whose turn it is, while the
material row and move list update throughout the game. Premoves can be entered
while Maia is thinking. A takeback restores the board and clock; the abandoned
line is retained as a variation when the PGN is copied.

</p>

### Review with Stockfish and Maia

After a game, select **Review with Stockfish**. The board remains fixed at the
top while **Moves** and **Graph** switch the panel below it. Select any move to
jump directly to that position. The evaluation bar and blue arrow show
Stockfish's assessment and best move. Maia also suggests the most likely human
move at the configured rating; when it differs from Stockfish it is shown with
an orange arrow, and when it agrees only the shared blue arrow is shown.

Full-game analysis adds separate White and Black accuracy percentages and a
tap-to-navigate evaluation graph. Move the pieces from any reviewed position to
explore a branch; analysis variations are retained in exported PGN.

## Install and update with Obtainium

[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) installs Android apps directly
from their official release pages and can notify you when updates are available.

1. Install Obtainium from its
   [official releases page](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases/latest).
2. Open Obtainium, select **Add App**, and paste this URL into **App Source URL**:

   ```text
   https://github.com/Dash1971/maia-chess-android-preview
   ```

3. Confirm that Obtainium detects **GitHub** as the source and enable
   **Include prereleases**.
4. Select **Add**, open **Mobile Maia Preview** in Obtainium, and select
   **Install**.
5. If Android asks, allow Obtainium to install unknown apps, then approve the
   Mobile Maia Preview APK installation.

After setup, use Obtainium's update check to download and install future Maia
Chess releases. Android may ask you to confirm each update.

## Build

Requirements: **Flutter 3.47.1** (pinned in `.fvmrc`), JDK 17, Android SDK 36,
Python 3, and Git LFS. Use the locked dependencies. A GitHub source ZIP contains
an LFS pointer rather than the 316 MB Maia model, so clone with Git LFS:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dash1971/maia-chess-android-preview.git
cd maia-chess-android-preview
git lfs install
git lfs pull
python3 tool/verify_model.py
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
flutter analyze
flutter test
tool/build_android_release.sh
```

The ARM64 release APK is written to
`build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`.
It packages the mobile ARM64 ABI instead of bundling unused CPU architectures.
Use this same script for official releases and independent rebuilds. It sets a
fixed source timestamp, prepares stable generated Dart source URIs, and leaves
obfuscation disabled. Gradle also verifies the model's exact size and SHA-256,
so a direct `flutter build` cannot silently package a placeholder or altered
model. The build downloads dependencies; installed release apps work offline.

To check reproducibility, build the **same commit** in two clean directories
with the same pinned toolchain and no signing variables, then compare the
unsigned APKs using `sha256sum`. Retain both hashes with the release notes;
the procedure is not itself evidence that a particular release reproduced.
The manual Checks workflow can build an unsigned APK; pull requests run the
Dart analyzer and regression tests.

Official releases are signed with the dedicated Mobile Maia app-signing key.
The build reads `MOBILE_MAIA_KEYSTORE`, `MOBILE_MAIA_STORE_PASSWORD`, and
`MOBILE_MAIA_KEY_PASSWORD` from the environment; no signing secrets belong in
this repository. When those variables are absent, Gradle produces an unsigned
release suitable for independent F-Droid rebuilding.

The official signing certificate SHA-256 digest is:

```text
cd6c07c4efacf52bcccb83009b522c1dcad4a171197505a486f0a58edb6f172e
```

## Re-export Maia-3

The checked-in ONNX model was exported from the official Maia-3 79M checkpoint.
The exporter verifies ONNX Runtime outputs against PyTorch before succeeding.

```sh
python -m pip install /path/to/maia3 onnx onnxruntime
python tool/export_maia3_onnx.py --model maia3-79m --output assets/models/maia3-79m.onnx
```

## Credits

Mobile Maia uses the
[Maia-3 project](https://github.com/CSSLab/maia3) and its 79M model. Maia-3 was
created by the University of Toronto Computational Social Science Lab to model
human chess move choices at different rating levels. The app includes an About
screen linking directly to the upstream project and source code.

The board interface is provided by
[Lichess Flutter Chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/flutter-chessground),
including the default Lichess brown theme and Cburnett pieces. Local Stockfish
support uses
[Lichess multistockfish](https://github.com/lichess-org/dart-multistockfish).
Both Lichess projects are credited and linked in the app's About screen.

Game Review's move-classification and sacrifice-detection heuristics are
adapted and translated to Dart from
[En Croissant](https://github.com/franciscoBSalgueiro/en-croissant), the
open-source chess GUI by Francisco Salgueiro and contributors. Mobile Maia
retains the upstream classification rules while adding bounded search,
background-isolate execution, and its own review integration. The pinned
upstream revision and licence details are recorded in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Offline games and files

Games and analysis are checkpointed in app-private files, with a previous-good
backup. Home and New game keep the previous session in **Recent games**, where
it can be reopened or explicitly deleted. The legacy preference checkpoint is
migrated on first launch. Android may erase app-private data when the app is
uninstalled; use **Save PGN file** or **Share PGN** to keep an independent copy.

**Open PGN file**, Android's Open with action, and shared PGN attachments import
a single game with its variations, comments and annotations. Files are limited
to 2 MB and 20,000 moves across all branches. Save and share use Android's
system picker and temporary URI grants; no storage or Internet permission is
required. PGN import uses the first game in a multi-game document.

Training clocks pause while the app is backgrounded, while reviewing the
current game, or after a Maia error. Returning resumes the saved clock; Retry
restarts a failed Maia turn. Analysis stops scheduling engine work offscreen.
Selecting a position gets a short Stockfish search, then a longer refinement
if it remains selected. Full computer analysis uses the longer budget.
